# Jib-Crane-design (First part of the PDF)
Components design and sizing of a jib crane for static application. This is accomplished by means of the Safety Factor (SF) evaluation of the overall structure and global vertical deformation minimization of the carried weight point of application. The connection components are investigated by verifying the equivalent stress (Tresca method) under 2 configurations of the structure: horizontal beam at 0° (longitudial axis along the x-y plane) and 90° (longitudinal axis along the y-z plane)
The project was developed as a assigment for the course of Mechanical Design & Machine Elements, Industrial Engineering Department of the University of Trento, in collaboration with Michele Denicolò. 
The results and the adopted design choices are presented in the pdf file MECHANICAL DESIGN ASSIGNMENT and the MATLAB scripts are contained in the JIB CRANE EVALUATION folder.
